So, I was watching Ferris Bueller's Day Off ("[FBDO][]" to me and my friends). I had just seen [Fight Club][], and I was thinking about it. Here's what I thought.

> "Sometimes, people just happen. They were friends one day, then the next, they're strangers. Luckily thanks to evolution, a new friend joins your social circle. This is how single serving friend don't hurt, this is how you can breathe each day."

Honestly, I don't know why I think this is in any way clever. I think I just amuse myself too much. If you're so compelled, let me know what you think.
