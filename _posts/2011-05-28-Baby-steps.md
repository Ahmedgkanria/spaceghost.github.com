So, you may have noticed that I've been off in my own little world with [Monoceros][].
I've been trying to become a bit more competent at the tools that I use before pushing out initial tests for you to peruse.
But you know what? Screw you. I mean this in the nicest way, I really do.

What I really meant to say was, "Hey, I really appreciate you a lot. But I really need to just get code out there, and I know it won't be the best."
You know what? That makes me feel liberated. Not that I don't care what you think, this is more of a personal victory than some petty realization.
I'll just toss out tests and features and get some feedback, that's safe right? You won't bite me, won't you?

With that said, I think it's safe enough to point out that my test will suck.
I'm trying to be clever, writing tests for metaprogramming sounds so daunting. Perhaps painful?

Thank you for conspiring with me against myself,
